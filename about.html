            <div class="about-description-caption">“Its not the destination, its the journey.” - Ralph Waldo Emerson</div>

                <p>Ever dream about exploring arts and crafts in a rural setting - a trail leading to creative learning and deep
                cultural exploration?<strong> We’d like to help you discover that journey.</strong></p>

                <p>That journey into lesser known places, perched away from the crowds that seek ‘must do’ sights. For, the very
                things that people want to see and experience when they travel can be spoilt by too great a volume. <strong>We’d like
                to help you strike a balance between those ‘must do’ activities and the local experiences.</strong></p>

                <p>So much of getting to know a place, its culture and heritage, lies in trying to get as close as possible to the
                local community. Putting the community at the heart of the experience, and to prioritize regions where locals
                are still genuinely curious to meet travellers. <strong>We strive to bring onboard local collaborators to help navigate
                the cultural horizon through interactive participation.</strong></p>

                <p>Experience bonding with local artisans, makers, producers, artists, as they converse in the language of their 
                art. Its the learnings from a unique blend of fun interactions, stories and group initiatives that makes the 
                journey an invaluable experience.  <strong>Truly memorable experiences are about people and narratives.</strong></p>

                <p>All these comes with the added responsibility on the traveller’s part to seek environmentally sustainable
                means during travel, one that does not harm natural and cultural environment.</p>
